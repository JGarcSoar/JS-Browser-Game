The innitial inspiration for this game are tv trivia games like "Who wants to be a millionaire?".

The player will start the game with a score of 0 and as they answer questions correctly they'll be awarded points for it, however if they answer the questions incorrectly they will be met with the Game Over! Once the player reaches 1000000 score they will win the game and have a change to restart. The game will allow the player to skip only one question at any given run, but they are allowed to quit the game at any point.
